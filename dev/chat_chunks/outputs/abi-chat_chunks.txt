[04/02/2018 17:12] Alex: Damn one of my songs just produced so much bass the speaker bounced and the sofa shook

[04/02/2018 17:21] Abi Vickers: What music you listening to?!
[04/02/2018 17:21] Alex: Yeah, i just did a bass test and there was a longish period of time where the bass was playing but it was so deep that it kinda disconnected the bluetooth
[04/02/2018 17:22] Alex: It literally made the sofa shake for that period of time
[04/02/2018 17:22] Alex: And im currently listening to soundtrackw

[04/02/2018 17:41] Abi Vickers: Click the heating up if it's a bit cold
[04/02/2018 17:41] Abi Vickers: On the temperature thermostat
[04/02/2018 17:41] Alex: Ok

[04/02/2018 18:46] Abi Vickers: Did your mum wash tour trousers
[04/02/2018 18:46] Alex: No marylin did

[04/02/2018 18:46] Abi Vickers: Right ok. See you soon xx
[10/02/2018 18:43] Alex: I have finished travelling, i dont have roaming so i wasnt able to message you, i havnt slept at all yet, i cant message you for some reason, however i can message you like this

[10/02/2018 18:44] Abi Vickers: Bless you..no sleep! That's crazy.. is it cold?
[10/02/2018 18:45] Alex: It wasnt that cold at all
[10/02/2018 18:45] Alex: I was able to pick up snow at this level with bare hands and it wasnt cold

[10/02/2018 18:45] Abi Vickers: Steve sent this
[10/02/2018 18:45] Abi Vickers: Glad you're safe have a great time!
[10/02/2018 18:46] Alex: Ok

[11/02/2018 08:18] Abi Vickers: Morning! god I bet you're shattered for your first day skiing! Be careful.out there!
[11/02/2018 20:00] Abi Vickers: How has your first day been???
[11/02/2018 20:28] Alex: Its been ok, im kinda tired only because jamie woke me and jack up in the night, we are all already annoyed at just him, skiing is fine, i progressed as slower than usual yet at the end i progressed really quick and made my own method up, however continuously getting hip and foot cramps with this method, food in my opinion is really decent, for dinner we have a starter main and desert

[11/02/2018 20:32] Abi Vickers: Thank you for such a lovely summary! 😊 tell Jamie "miss Vickers is not impressed"
[12/02/2018 17:41] Abi Vickers: Better day today? X
[12/02/2018 18:24] Alex: Yes, progress is great, im getting the hang of it very well, my legs are not hurting, jokes on everyone else, this i believe is because of my continuous parkour excersises i do with my friends, the boots are no longer starting to hurt me and i am starting to get used to them.
[12/02/2018 18:24] Alex: Even though i got no sleep again i am still good

[12/02/2018 20:45] Abi Vickers: You sobt have to answer it's fine 😊t ry n get couple of photos if you can xxc
[12/02/2018 20:46] Abi Vickers: One question though lol... is all your ski stuff ok?
[12/02/2018 20:58] Alex: Yes its fine

[12/02/2018 20:44] Abi Vickers: Haha! Well don't get too cocky! Try n get early night tonight. You ok doing suncream n lipstuff? Not feeling faint?
[13/02/2018 16:49] Abi Vickers: Yey!!! Thanks for these! Looks fab! Another good day then?
[13/02/2018 16:57] Alex: Yes it was a good day, we went on the main mountain and i learned how to parrallell ski, my only problem is parrallel right turns, most the time when i try to do them i shoot off and torpedo into the ground

[10/02/2018 18:45] Abi Vickers: Just realised he might have international call barring on his phone... and he did! Sorry!!! I've just turned it off so he should be able to send and receive texts now!
[13/02/2018 17:05] Abi Vickers: Torpedo?! Haha!!! Sounds  hilarious yet painful!
[13/02/2018 17:06] Alex: do what u like with the photos
[13/02/2018 17:06] Alex: and it wasnt painful at all, i did get a lot of snow on people around me because of the force, it was like a car passing by a puddle of water but except this time it was rain
[13/02/2018 17:07] Alex: *snow not rain

[13/02/2018 17:07] Abi Vickers: 🤣🤣🤣 that's brilliant. You are so descriptive!
[13/02/2018 17:08] Abi Vickers: Have you bought a mug yet?!
[13/02/2018 17:08] Alex: i mean, im really fast, so my falls and crashes are very satisfying and big
[13/02/2018 17:08] Alex: and no
[13/02/2018 17:08] Alex: havnt been to a proper shop

[13/02/2018 17:13] Abi Vickers: Oh god..dont break anything!!!
[13/02/2018 17:14] Alex: lol

[13/02/2018 17:14] Abi Vickers: Are you ok temperature wise
[13/02/2018 17:14] Alex: i dont wear my jumper
[13/02/2018 17:14] Alex: but im relatively hot
[13/02/2018 20:17] Alex: if marylin gets peed off that im not answering tell her i literally cannot answer her anyway
[13/02/2018 20:18] Alex: i said to you before i dont have roaming, i cant take calls either so make sure she knows

[14/02/2018 18:18] Abi Vickers: Still ok?!😊
[14/02/2018 18:24] Abi Vickers: Photo of you actually skiing without goggles would be fab!
[14/02/2018 18:26] Alex: not happening, im not taking a picture of myself with actual skin on, i will only do that if im unnoticable to most people
[14/02/2018 18:26] Alex: and im doing really well
[14/02/2018 20:36] Alex: and if your wondering why i am taking selfied its because my front camera lens got screwed up
[14/02/2018 20:36] Alex: *selfies

[13/02/2018 20:39] Abi Vickers: Ohhh bless you. I will let her know..no problem!😊
[14/02/2018 20:40] Abi Vickers: Erm it looks like a wall?!
[14/02/2018 20:40] Alex: ok then

[14/02/2018 20:40] Abi Vickers: What happened to the camera lense
[14/02/2018 20:40] Alex: so you see the contrast in my hand

[14/02/2018 20:41] Abi Vickers: Ah blurry
[14/02/2018 20:41] Alex: i cant really take a photo of my own camera lens

[14/02/2018 20:41] Abi Vickers: Probably the cold weather has affected it?
[14/02/2018 20:41] Alex: no, its smashed

[14/02/2018 20:41] Abi Vickers: Lol you dropped it?!
[14/02/2018 20:41] Alex: if i get the glass out of the lens then it will look normal however unprotected

[14/02/2018 20:42] Abi Vickers: Or is it all the torpedoing you've been doing?!
[14/02/2018 20:42] Alex: no, i accidentally smashed it when i was raging at the crap wifi, i didnt realise the table was multiple tables together and one of them stuck out a bit
[14/02/2018 20:42] Alex: the corner went into my lens
[14/02/2018 20:43] Alex: turns out the lens was the most delicate part lol

[14/02/2018 20:43] Abi Vickers: Oh dear!!  And you thought it was unbreakable!
[14/02/2018 20:43] Alex: it is unbreakable
[14/02/2018 20:43] Alex: the lens just isnt

[14/02/2018 20:43] Abi Vickers: Sooooo what have you learnt from this then?!🤣
[14/02/2018 20:44] Alex: that i be careful to smash my phone a bit morr gentally on my lens, or avoid the lens
[14/02/2018 20:44] Alex: *more

[14/02/2018 20:44] Abi Vickers: You div!
[14/02/2018 20:44] Alex: and make sure to check what im smashing my phone on

[14/02/2018 20:45] Abi Vickers: Or simply look after your phone and don't rage over stupid things,!!
[14/02/2018 20:45] Alex: no

[14/02/2018 20:45] Abi Vickers: Hmm
[14/02/2018 20:45] Alex: because when i smash my phone things actually seem to work
[14/02/2018 20:45] Alex: like the pintrest meme i was loading
[14/02/2018 20:46] Alex: or that youtube vid im trying to watch

[14/02/2018 20:46] Abi Vickers: Pfft
[14/02/2018 20:46] Alex: or that whatsapp message in trying to send

[14/02/2018 20:46] Abi Vickers: Are you ready to come home now? You had enough?
[14/02/2018 20:46] Alex: it works when i smash or throw it in something
[14/02/2018 20:46] Alex: no

[14/02/2018 20:46] Abi Vickers: Just checking!
[14/02/2018 20:46] Alex: for some reason being here seems normal

[14/02/2018 20:47] Abi Vickers: Cause you're a snow boy
[14/02/2018 20:47] Alex: it feels as if im coming back to something
[14/02/2018 20:47] Alex: it basically feels like i belong here

[14/02/2018 20:47] Abi Vickers: You belong in the snow and mountains
[14/02/2018 20:47] Alex: i know

[14/02/2018 20:47] Abi Vickers: 😘😘😘
[14/02/2018 20:48] Alex: i wanna do some form of mountain climbing now

[14/02/2018 20:48] Abi Vickers: Ohhh that's cool
[14/02/2018 20:48] Abi Vickers: Ask Steve maybe you can do some in France
[14/02/2018 20:48] Alex: it seems really fun, to climb to the peak of a mountain and basically feel unstoppabke
[14/02/2018 20:48] Alex: *unstoppable

[14/02/2018 20:48] Abi Vickers: Not the same but an idea
[14/02/2018 20:49] Alex: and no, there arnt snowy mountains there as far as im aware

[14/02/2018 20:49] Abi Vickers: Oh you want snow mountains
[14/02/2018 20:50] Alex: i wanna do it here or norway or somewhere with massive mountains, and if you think im mental and not thinking i need ti train im not, i feel as if id be relatively good at the start
[14/02/2018 20:50] Alex: and if not id learn from climbing the mountain and any mistakes i made along the way of the climb

[14/02/2018 20:51] Abi Vickers: Sounds like a plan.. there would be organised ones you could so with professionals I would think
[14/02/2018 20:51] Alex: oh ok

[14/02/2018 20:52] Abi Vickers: Have to look into it
[14/02/2018 20:52] Abi Vickers: I'm so pleased you went skiing though
[14/02/2018 20:52] Alex: im really enjoying skiing
[14/02/2018 20:53] Alex: its so fast, you should probably go
[14/02/2018 20:53] Alex: thats if you like fast things

[14/02/2018 20:53] Abi Vickers: Too fast for me probs!!
[14/02/2018 20:54] Alex: ok, this is sorted already and will probably scare you, and the school told everyone not to tell parents until it was sorted but it is sorted already so im think im fine telling you
[14/02/2018 20:54] Alex: but two students went to hospital today because of accidents made

[14/02/2018 20:55] Abi Vickers: Shit! What happened?!
[14/02/2018 20:55] Alex: one had a torn something, probably a torn ligament, and now is walking on crutches for comfort reasons
[14/02/2018 20:56] Alex: and the other i think basically harpooned his leg with a skiing pole, although im not fully sure what happened, but i think it went to his bone, it was really gruesome
[14/02/2018 20:56] Alex: and looked painful

[14/02/2018 20:57] Abi Vickers: Oh my godddddd!!!!
[14/02/2018 20:57] Alex: one is in my year and the other is either in year 10 or 9

[14/02/2018 20:57] Abi Vickers: Was the one with the pole jamie?!
[14/02/2018 20:57] Abi Vickers: Sounds like something he's do!😂
[14/02/2018 20:58] Alex: no

[14/02/2018 20:58] Abi Vickers: I'm not telling marilyn that story until you are home safe and sound lol
[14/02/2018 20:58] Alex: the one with the pole was brandon in my year

[15/02/2018 18:49] Abi Vickers: Just want to check you haven't harpooned any vital organs today?
[15/02/2018 18:50] Abi Vickers: Are you skiing tomorrow or just travelling back?

[08/08/2018 13:42] Abi Vickers: Is Aaron still at home?
[08/08/2018 13:42] Alex: nope hes just gone
[08/08/2018 13:50] Alex: abi actually, im not doing paperwork until i get my results back
[08/08/2018 13:50] Alex: because i just realised worst case senario i might have to redo some crap

[08/08/2018 14:04] Abi Vickers: Lol
[08/08/2018 14:04] Abi Vickers: Bless you good point. But what you could do is sort in 2 piles
[08/08/2018 14:04] Alex: i know the difference between revision piles

[30/07/2018 13:57] Abi Vickers: You went out and didn't even uncover joey
[08/08/2018 14:05] Abi Vickers: Fine. Hoover tour rug then
[08/08/2018 14:05] Alex: maybe

[08/08/2018 14:05] Abi Vickers: And can you check what the toilet looks like now
[08/08/2018 14:05] Abi Vickers: Alex you've got to something else with your time. You've done nothing all week
[08/08/2018 14:05] Alex: no because within a matter of 2 days its gone to crap

[30/07/2018 08:34] Abi Vickers: Can I suggest when you want a snack at night get yourself a bowl of cereal? Be much better.. there's cocoa pops so still chocolatey. X
[08/08/2018 14:05] Abi Vickers: That's a crap excuse
[08/08/2018 14:05] Alex: im not letting you look at my toilet
[08/08/2018 14:06] Alex: i can tell you its already bad

[08/08/2018 14:06] Abi Vickers: Oh let's not do the washing because the clothes will get dirty again
[08/08/2018 14:06] Alex: thats different

[08/08/2018 14:06] Abi Vickers: Why is it
[08/08/2018 14:06] Alex: having constant leaky crap and messing up my toilet really bad is very different

[08/08/2018 14:07] Abi Vickers: You were using that excuse for not hoovering rug I thought
[08/08/2018 14:07] Alex: oh i wasnt

[08/08/2018 14:08] Alex: naa, thats just an 'if i can be arsed'
[08/08/2018 14:08] Alex: and yes that was in relation to my toilet
[08/08/2018 14:09] Alex: so to simplify, i definitely cant be arsed to clean my toilet atm, but i might do my rug today, if not today then tomorrow, but more likely today
[08/08/2018 14:11] Alex: oh and you know whats even more crappy?
[08/08/2018 14:11] Alex: my pc is being a pain and not turning on again, so its not actually fixed
[08/08/2018 14:11] Alex: but we tried

[09/08/2018 14:01] Abi Vickers: I spoke to the pharmacist at boots today and discussed symptoms etc.
[09/08/2018 14:01] Abi Vickers: If you've had leaky poo this morning have another Imodium.. can have it over couple of days but then stop
[09/08/2018 14:04] Alex: ok, well suprisingly this morning i dont have leaky poo

[09/08/2018 14:00] Abi Vickers: How you feeling?
[09/08/2018 14:05] Abi Vickers: Maybe the Imodium kicked in then!
[09/08/2018 14:05] Alex: idk

[27/12/2018 02:04] Alex: yes
[27/12/2018 14:16] Alex: steve is finally moaning at me for being myself
[27/12/2018 14:16] Alex: it lasted 3 days

[27/12/2018 14:39] Abi Vickers: What's he moaning at? I did speak to him yesterday asking about assignments and he did say you didn't eat Christmas dinner with them
[27/12/2018 14:40] Abi Vickers: He said this league of legions game you play can take several hours too, so before you play it you need to make sure you are not expected to do anything in those next few hours
[27/12/2018 14:52] Alex: i did eat christmas dinner with them, that was one mistake i made because i didnt realise my game would take as long as it did
[27/12/2018 14:53] Alex: but other than that
[27/12/2018 14:53] Alex: and its *league of legends

[27/12/2018 14:53] Abi Vickers: So what's he moaning at then?
[27/12/2018 14:54] Alex: me, being myself

[27/12/2018 15:11] Abi Vickers: Probably not that, probably something specific you are doing / not doing
[27/12/2018 16:12] Abi Vickers: Are you grumpy or are you ok
[27/12/2018 16:53] Alex: im grumpy because they are moaning at me

[27/12/2018 17:45] Abi Vickers: You know it's Steve's birthday today
[27/12/2018 17:46] Abi Vickers: Have you done any work yet?
[27/12/2018 17:53] Alex: yes i have done work, and i didnt go downstairs for a while because i wanted to finish off a section

[27/12/2018 17:45] Abi Vickers: Why have you only just gone downstairs?
[30/12/2018 18:06] Abi Vickers: How's things??
[30/12/2018 18:07] Alex: fine i guess

[30/12/2018 18:07] Abi Vickers: That wasn't convincing
[30/12/2018 18:07] Abi Vickers: What's up
[30/12/2018 18:07] Alex: im getting forced to go out

[30/12/2018 18:08] Abi Vickers: Where to or just generally
[30/12/2018 18:08] Alex: dont say anything because its not too much of a big deal
[30/12/2018 18:08] Alex: but its just 'come walk the dog for some fresh air'

[30/12/2018 18:08] Abi Vickers: Ok I won't. You went for a nice meal and drank margaritas didn't you
[30/12/2018 18:08] Alex: yes
[30/12/2018 18:08] Alex: that was fine

[30/12/2018 18:09] Abi Vickers: How are the assignments  goung?
[30/12/2018 18:09] Alex: but its just the 'you need fresh air' part that really annoys me
[30/12/2018 18:09] Alex: im doing my resub now

[30/12/2018 18:09] Abi Vickers: Ah ok cool
[30/12/2018 18:10] Abi Vickers: Did you turn it around and hep Steve enjoy his birthday?
[30/12/2018 18:10] Alex: and im also talking to kaid about airsoft, its only 20/25 pounds and he said i can join him
[30/12/2018 18:10] Alex: and idk abi

[30/12/2018 18:11] Abi Vickers: I'm unsure what you mean... you don't know if Steve had a nice birthday you mean? That's cool about airsoft
[30/12/2018 18:12] Alex: i think he had a nice bday

[30/12/2018 18:13] Abi Vickers: The fresh air thing is what adults say when you need a break and stretch and walk. Think how knackered you are to do parkour,  you should run around a bit with the dog and get fitter for it hey
[30/12/2018 18:14] Alex: no because i need something specific to do excersice with such as my bar
[30/12/2018 18:14] Alex: i dont have a valid reason to run, theres no objective
[30/12/2018 18:14] Alex: and all the objectives i went through in my head are a bit stupid

[30/12/2018 18:15] Abi Vickers: Yes that would be ideal with the bar, I know what you are saying, I don't like "going for a walk" if there's no destination
[30/12/2018 18:15] Alex: www.skirmishcombatgames.co.uk

[30/12/2018 18:15] Abi Vickers: But you do need to get fitter lol and so do o to be fair so we should try and do more
[30/12/2018 18:16] Alex: btw thats the airsoft stuff

[30/12/2018 18:16] Abi Vickers: The link, yes I've read about it before
[30/12/2018 18:16] Alex: i might pay 20/25 pounds to go there with kaid soon
[30/12/2018 18:16] Alex: its in lutterworth
[30/12/2018 18:16] Alex: the only problem is transport

[30/12/2018 18:17] Abi Vickers: How does Kaid get there?
[30/12/2018 18:17] Alex: idk, hes gone to get dinner

[30/12/2018 18:17] Abi Vickers: He lives quite close to us. Ok I'm sure us parents could do one way each or something
[30/12/2018 18:18] Alex: oh i was thinking bus, but thats my answer to everything so idk

[30/12/2018 18:20] Abi Vickers: That's good that you would think that first! Less reliant on me and more independent😊 but if the bus is far and timings are crap I'm sure I can take you, depends on when obviously
[30/12/2018 19:37] Alex: nice

[15/05/2019 13:29] Abi Vickers: Can you call me please
[15/05/2019 13:32] Alex: why?
[15/05/2019 13:32] Alex: im already talking with rhea
[15/05/2019 13:33] Alex: and ive just got up

[15/05/2019 10:12] Abi Vickers: Hello, ive had a meeting this morning with Alex's teaching staff and work experiance co-ordinator. Students have to try and find there own work experiance however if they can't thats fine as college then find a placement. They are still in the processof finding Alex a week somewhere. However for this week it was suggested for Alex to come into college to catch up on the work he's behind on. Because most students are out, Alex could have 121 with Tim lead of his course to sit down with him and go through work and support him. Ive asked Alex if he would come in. There isn't classes on so its Alex choice however it would really benifit him to get in the next 3 days. Many Thanks Rea
[15/05/2019 13:33] Abi Vickers: OK fair enough, but work experience woman has rang me twice
[15/05/2019 13:33] Alex: abi ive just got up

I've been watching this thing for years called "critical role" it's professional voice actors that used to play as a home game and then started streaming and it blew up massively! I'm on season 2 now and it's still going but season 1 had over 100 episodes all of them over 3 hours long. It's also a good way to get into another character and express different feelings actually being in the role play. I've heard loads about it helping people with anxiety and stuff.
[16/01/2020 13:12] Abi Vickers: Hope you're in now
[16/01/2020 13:12] Alex: why?

[20/11/2020 10:00] Alex: ?

[16/11/2020 21:05] Abi Vickers: On the morning of 10th October I woke up early with some stomach cramps. I was a week over, and genuinely thought you'd never come out. Still, I didn't connect the dots, and didn't realise I was in labour, so happily sent your dad off to town to buy bread. That's a 1 hour drive each way. So when he came back, your grandma, Sølvi, who lived in the same apartments at the time, was in one hundred thousand panic mode. Nothing unusual, she gets into that mode 5 seconds after she starts looking for her keys in her purse. Every. Time. But even I was a bit eager to set off to the hospital when he got back, another 2 hour drive. By then I knew you were coming. We drove up in his big red Mercedes, the only time I've driven without a seat belt, as by then, I could NOT sit still. And then he stopped at a gas station for cigarettes. I remember pacing back and forth outside, it seemed to take forever. Finally we get to the hospital, I waddle up to the birth suites on....5th floor I think. I remember looking out the window on our birth room, and we were high up, looking out at some tall, spindly pines with soggy wet but thick snow on the branches. I got helped out of my clothes, into a hospital gown, onto a bed, and at THAT moment my water broke. You were very polite. From that moment it was just a bunch of pushing for like 4 hours I think. We arrived around 1pm'ish at the hospital, and you plopped out around 5'ish. I can only remember it hurting for two contractions, when your head breached, until it came out. I got you up onto my chest first of all, umbilical cord still attached, not cleaned up. Someone put a blanket over you (and a hat maybe?) and I got to nuzzle you while your dad cut the cord. From then on I didn't want to let you go for even a moment. I didn't let you out of my sight for the whole duration of our hospital stay. I remember I brought a royal blue one piece with sailor details for bringing you home with. It was so soft, and still you were softer. That piece of clothing was so tiny, it never fit you again, only for that one trip to the hospital.
[20/11/2020 10:04] Abi Vickers: I don't know what ahhhh means
[20/11/2020 10:04] Alex: it means what it says

[20/11/2020 10:06] Abi Vickers: Could mean arrgghhhh nooooo
[20/11/2020 10:06] Abi Vickers: Or ah right
[20/11/2020 10:07] Alex: just AHHHHHHH

[16/11/2020 21:05] Abi Vickers: I went a week over. Your cousing Orion was born exactly 1 month before you, almost to the minute. You were born shortly after 17:00, I can't remember exactly, while Orion arrive just before 5 on 10th September. So your dad and me (heavily pregnant with you) sat right outside the room you would be delivered in, one month before, and watched the twin towers fall, in the middle of a ton of new mothers with their emotions already in a twist. I tell you, I've not cried so hard since Princess Diana died. Orion's mum, your aunt Carina, was in labor with him on the day of voting in Norway, and was mentioned in the newspaper for having asked the ambulance to take her to the polling station, but they wouldn't let her vote,because they didn't open for another hour.
[20/11/2020 10:07] Abi Vickers: Still not clear

[20/10/2021 16:02] Alex: hmm

[10/10/2021 12:40] Abi Vickers: Ok so.. there's all these guys who are professional voice actors, they've been in games, anime, films and TV series and they're all best friends who play dungeons and dragons. One day they get invited to stream their game online, thinking it will flop they say sure, what's the worst that can happen. And it takes off big time! Their first campaign lasted for about 2 years with around 115 episodes and over 400 hours. And then a few months laters they start campaign 2 which goes for even longer around 140 episodes. Anyway they're huge now and the fans wanted an animated version of the show, so they started a Kickstarter with the goal being $750,000 to make 1 episode of anime. And the goal was reached in less than an hour. So they had to come up with stretch goals. Each goal meaning more episodes for the animated show and other rewards for the fans. And each time they set a new goal it was smashed! Over 88,000 people donated and they raised over 11.3 million smashing the record for most money donated to and film and TV Kickstarter. It was insane! And then to make it even crazier Amazon found out how huge they were and wanted to fund a second season of the animated show and have it air on Amazon Prime! The whole thing is nuts, I've been watching this show for years, literal years and now they're gonna make an anime of it. And campaign 3 starts on the 21st of October and that will probably be the biggest of the lot with how much attention they've received and how much they've grown and how many new people know about them now. It's insane and it's fucking awesome and I can't wait to see it lol
