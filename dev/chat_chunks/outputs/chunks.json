  "[16/11/2020 21:05] Abi Vickers: On the morning of 10th October I woke up early with some stomach cramps. I was a week over, and genuinely thought you'd never come out. Still, I didn't connect the dots, and didn't realise I was in labour, so happily sent your dad off to town to buy bread. That's a 1 hour drive each way. So when he came back, your grandma, Sølvi, who lived in the same apartments at the time, was in one hundred thousand panic mode. Nothing unusual, she gets into that mode 5 seconds after she starts looking for her keys in her purse. Every. Time. But even I was a bit eager to set off to the hospital when he got back, another 2 hour drive. By then I knew you were coming. We drove up in his big red Mercedes, the only time I've driven without a seat belt, as by then, I could NOT sit still. And then he stopped at a gas station for cigarettes. I remember pacing back and forth outside, it seemed to take forever. Finally we get to the hospital, I waddle up to the birth suites on....5th floor I think. I remember looking out the window on our birth room, and we were high up, looking out at some tall, spindly pines with soggy wet but thick snow on the branches. I got helped out of my clothes, into a hospital gown, onto a bed, and at THAT moment my water broke. You were very polite. From that moment it was just a bunch of pushing for like 4 hours I think. We arrived around 1pm'ish at the hospital, and you plopped out around 5'ish. I can only remember it hurting for two contractions, when your head breached, until it came out. I got you up onto my chest first of all, umbilical cord still attached, not cleaned up. Someone put a blanket over you (and a hat maybe?) and I got to nuzzle you while your dad cut the cord. From then on I didn't want to let you go for even a moment. I didn't let you out of my sight for the whole duration of our hospital stay. I remember I brought a royal blue one piece with sailor details for bringing you home with. It was so soft, and still you were softer. That piece of clothing was so tiny, it never fit you again, only for that one trip to the hospital.\n[20/11/2020 10:04] Abi Vickers: I don't know what ahhhh means\n[20/11/2020 10:04] Alex: it means what it says",

So your dad and me (heavily pregnant with you) sat right outside the room you would be delivered in, one month before, and watched the twin towers fall, in the middle of a ton of new mothers with their emotions already in a twist. I tell you, I've not cried so hard since Princess Diana died. Orion's mum, your aunt Carina, was in labor with him on the day of voting in Norway, and was mentioned in the newspaper for having asked the ambulance to take her to the polling station, but they wouldn't let her vote,because they didn't open for another hour.\n[20/11/2020 10:07] Abi Vickers: Still not clear\n[20/11/2020 10:07] Alex: dw it doesnt need to be",

One day they get invited to stream their game online, thinking it will flop they say sure, what's the worst that can happen. And it takes off big time! Their first campaign lasted for about 2 years with around 115 episodes and over 400 hours. And then a few months laters they start campaign 2 which goes for even longer around 140 episodes. Anyway they're huge now and the fans wanted an animated version of the show, so they started a Kickstarter with the goal being $750,000 to make 1 episode of anime. And the goal was reached in less than an hour. So they had to come up with stretch goals. Each goal meaning more episodes for the animated show and other rewards for the fans. And each time they set a new goal it was smashed! Over 88,000 people donated and they raised over 11.3 million smashing the record for most money donated to and film and TV Kickstarter. It was insane! And then to make it even crazier Amazon found out how huge they were and wanted to fund a second season of the animated show and have it air on Amazon Prime! The whole thing is nuts, I've been watching this show for years, literal years and now they're gonna make an anime of it. And campaign 3 starts on the 21st of October and that will probably be the biggest of the lot with how much attention they've received and how much they've grown and how many new people know about them now.
