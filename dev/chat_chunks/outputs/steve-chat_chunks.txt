[31/12/2015 12:45] Alex: OK. If it's cheaper on your site then buy it there

[31/10/2018 19:37] Alex: sorry i missed your call, i was elsewhere
[31/10/2018 19:55] Alex: steve?
[31/10/2018 19:55] Alex: Missed voice call

[31/10/2018 20:01] Alex: ahh ok
[31/10/2018 21:28] Alex: Account Number: 53091260
[31/10/2018 21:45] Alex: give me 10 seconds
[31/10/2018 21:45] Alex: im taking a crap atm
[01/11/2018 13:39] Alex: yo steve, remember to do the money
[01/11/2018 16:06] Alex: yo steve...

[01/11/2018 17:15] Steve: Yo dude. I've transferred it over. It may take an hour to get to you. Let me know when you have it in your account.
[01/11/2018 17:21] Alex: ok
[01/11/2018 18:19] Alex: it came through
[09/11/2018 00:50] Alex: you know what steve, its the small things in diablo 3 that makes you recognise how much effort is actually put into boss fights within the game, i decided to go onto my hardcore character, being a wizard, and play that, i dont know what difficulty it is, but i made it to skeleton king to fight him, and damn he was tough, he could 2 hit me, and only then did i realise that loads of his attacks were carefully planned out and well made because with enough speed and thought i avoided all of them, and when the minions spawned there was a chance for them to completely block me in, so i had to do a quick manouver to prevent that from happening so i dont die
[09/11/2018 01:15] Alex: i even had to sacrifice a loot goblin

[09/11/2018 03:00] Steve: It's cool you're thinking about the fight sequences and planning 👍
[09/11/2018 03:01] Steve: Can't believe you let a loot goblin go 😂
[09/11/2018 03:02] Alex: i had to, there were 3 elites that could 2 shot me somewhat

[09/11/2018 02:59] Steve: It is a pretty clever game. Blizzard are really good at doing boss fights, World of Warcraft bosses are great. They all have lots of phases. When we do some game development stuff we'll plan some good boss fights, last phase taking lots of damage but also causing high damage.
[09/11/2018 03:42] Steve: Did abi tell you I've booked the skiing flights!
[09/11/2018 03:42] Alex: yes

[12/11/2018 21:13] Steve: Stan Lee: Spider-Man, X-Men and Avengers creator dies aged 95

[14/11/2018 18:58] Steve: Did abi tell you that I'll get you on Friday lunchtime now instead?
[15/11/2018 21:34] Steve: Yo, can you be ready to go at 1pm tomorrow?
[15/11/2018 23:13] Alex: yeah sure
[16/11/2018 00:59] Alex: what exactly do you want me to bring?
[16/11/2018 01:00] Alex: for example, my computer etc

[16/11/2018 10:25] Steve: I think just your computer and chrome book. We'll reinstall everything on it. I did it to mine last week and everything is super fast now!

[27/11/2018 21:54] Alex: but turns out my friend thought it was in for tomorrow and panicked me, it wasnt in for tomorrow, its just a 'do as soon as possible' kind of thing

[27/11/2018 21:54] Steve: It is easy
[27/11/2018 21:54] Steve: And you will pick it up straight away

[10/05/2019 18:25] Alex: is the double jumping height meant to be random
[10/05/2019 18:27] Alex: additionally

[10/05/2019 18:28] Steve: It's based on how quickly you do the jumping
[10/05/2019 18:28] Steve: So you can change the height you jump off you time it right
[10/05/2019 18:28] Alex: is it meant to say "well done you have doubled your coins" all the time when you finish with coins

[20/02/2019 21:45] Steve: 👍
[10/05/2019 18:29] Steve: That's a place holder as I've turned the ads off

[10/05/2019 18:31] Steve: The music is crap. It needs changing.
[10/05/2019 18:31] Alex: something like this comes up just before it actually plays
[10/05/2019 18:32] Alex: and the music is fine

[10/05/2019 18:32] Steve: Oh, will investigate 👍
[10/05/2019 18:32] Alex: the game is alright
[10/05/2019 18:32] Alex: i think the monsters need some restriction to the platforms they are on though
[10/05/2019 18:33] Alex: wait actually
[10/05/2019 18:33] Alex: no

[10/05/2019 18:33] Steve: Sometimes they get trapped in the rocks
[10/05/2019 18:33] Alex: i forgot about the double jump height thing

[10/05/2019 18:33] Steve: Have you got as far as rocks spawning?
[10/05/2019 18:33] Alex: no
[10/05/2019 18:33] Alex: just been testing the basics

[10/05/2019 18:33] Steve: Cool
[10/05/2019 18:34] Alex: also, add a pause button
[10/05/2019 18:34] Alex: that would be good

[10/05/2019 18:34] Steve: Rocks start at at about 750 meters
[10/05/2019 18:34] Steve: Cheers dude, that's awesome feedback
[10/05/2019 18:34] Alex: glitches into the rock and died btw

[10/05/2019 18:35] Steve: That's not a glitch, you got a rock and you due
[10/05/2019 18:35] Steve: *die
[10/05/2019 18:35] Alex: also, is the funtion supposed to be if you jump too high you lose health
[10/05/2019 18:35] Alex: *function
[10/05/2019 18:35] Alex: sorry not the rock

[10/05/2019 18:35] Steve: Yep, if you get too high then you lose health
[10/05/2019 18:35] Steve: Maybe I take that off?
[10/05/2019 18:35] Alex: the platform
[10/05/2019 18:36] Alex: and yes

[10/05/2019 18:36] Steve: Same. If you crash into a platform then you die.
[10/05/2019 18:36] Alex: you lose way too much health
[10/05/2019 18:36] Alex: ahh ok
[10/05/2019 18:36] Alex: thats understandable

[10/05/2019 18:37] Steve: Does your mum have an Android?
[10/05/2019 18:37] Alex: yes

[20/07/2019 19:48] Alex: scratch pc specialist, that is expensive
[20/07/2019 19:48] Alex: what do you think to this

[30/06/2019 21:19] Steve: Can you please download my game. It is fully released now.
[20/07/2019 19:57] Steve: Never heard of them. I wouldn't get from eBay, you will not get a warranty if anything went wrong.
[20/07/2019 19:58] Alex: it comes with warrante

[30/06/2019 21:18] Steve: Yo Alex
[20/07/2019 19:59] Steve: With that much money I'd expect a 3 year warranty
[20/07/2019 19:59] Alex: well, ive talked to kaid and lots of other people and they said this was great
[20/07/2019 19:59] Alex: the pc itself

[30/06/2019 21:18] Steve: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dazzleisace.unicharge
[20/07/2019 19:59] Steve: eBay is not the place to get an expensive computer
[20/07/2019 20:00] Alex: well, its refurbished and stuff

[20/07/2019 20:00] Steve: HP are new to gaming PC's
[20/07/2019 20:00] Steve: I didn't even think they made them
[20/07/2019 20:01] Alex: im most likely getting this one though

[30/06/2019 20:13] Steve: 7, 8, 9 and 10 July
[20/07/2019 20:01] Steve: No, to a refurb. Has to be new, especially if you want it to last
[20/07/2019 20:01] Alex: its better than the ones at pc specialist and they are loads cheaper

[20/07/2019 20:01] Steve: Then look at the HP website, not eBay
[20/07/2019 20:02] Alex: and specifically, this pc is manufacture refurbished

[20/07/2019 20:02] Steve: Being sold by some random person on eBay
[20/07/2019 20:03] Alex: ive looked at their history and it seems legit
[20/07/2019 20:03] Alex: they have done lots of sales

[20/07/2019 20:12] Steve: https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/computing/pc/10-of-the-best-gaming-pcs-you-can-buy-in-2015-1304263
[20/07/2019 20:12] Steve: Just because it's expensive it doesn't mean it's better or faster
[20/07/2019 20:13] Alex: yes, but i cant afford these

[20/07/2019 20:13] Steve: You haven't looked through the list them
[20/07/2019 20:13] Steve: Obvs not the first ones
[20/07/2019 20:17] Alex: what im looking for within a pc is a 1080 ti as ive had explained to me and researched that some ill be able to run most games better with a 1080 than a 2080, however the 2080 is to run more recent games better, specifically games that support rtx

[20/07/2019 20:22] Steve: https://www.amazon.co.uk/ADMI-Gaming-PC-2400MHz-Masterbox/dp/B076BQ3Q31
[20/07/2019 20:22] Steve: rtx

[20/07/2019 20:23] Alex: but this one is a direct upgrade for not much more

[20/07/2019 20:24] Alex: 270
[20/07/2019 20:24] Alex: *2070
[20/07/2019 20:25] Alex: i read up on the 2060 because i was initially gonna get that
[20/07/2019 20:25] Alex: but its bad apparently
[20/07/2019 20:25] Alex: the 2070 is better
[20/07/2019 20:25] Alex: almost as good as a 2080

[20/07/2019 20:25] Steve: I don't think it's bad. They are all good, but the more expensive will be faster
[20/07/2019 20:26] Steve: Seems like both are good though 👍

[25/07/2019 16:42] Alex: i know i definitely want a ryzen amd with at least a 1080, 2070 or 2080

[25/07/2019 17:56] Steve: These are all too expensive
[25/07/2019 18:20] Alex: not really
[25/07/2019 18:20] Alex: my dad transfered a bunch of money
[25/07/2019 18:20] Alex: more than 300 pounds ish
[30/07/2019 15:58] Alex: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Intel-Core-I7-8700K-2tb-16gb-3000Mhz-RTX-2070-8gb-Star-Computer-Gaming-PC-/143005559914
[30/07/2019 15:58] Alex: how does this one look

[30/07/2019 22:59] Steve: Looks good at first glance.
[30/07/2019 22:59] Steve: I'll have a proper look tomorrow morning 👍
[02/08/2019 15:32] Alex: hey steve, my dad can only give me 300 pounds atm, but he can give me more money later
[02/08/2019 15:32] Alex: i can wait and all, but if i could get the pc sooner that would of course be better
[02/08/2019 15:32] Alex: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/AMD-Ryzen-7-2700x-32gb-Gaming-Home-Computer-Kolink-Phalanx-GTX-1080ti-up146/254172283724?hash=item3b2dd9434c:g:6JsAAOSwxetck5Cy
[02/08/2019 15:34] Alex: but im really looking at this pc right now, its from a company, it has 3 year warrantee and it has really high specs for its price, is there any chance you could lend me the remaining money or some additional money then i pay you back when i get the rest of the money from my dad?

[05/08/2019 01:21] Alex: love what you have done with the game
[05/08/2019 01:21] Alex: forgetful little sqaure
[05/08/2019 01:21] Alex: *square
[05/08/2019 01:21] Alex: i can jump now
[05/08/2019 01:21] Alex: and the game is pretty sweet
[05/08/2019 01:22] Alex: only issue is i think you might need to refine the platforms because from time to time i have issues and glitch into them, and also maybe increase the jump an inch or two

[06/08/2019 09:32] Steve: You'll have to show need the glitch. I think I know what you mean but it might be different to the one I know.
[06/08/2019 09:32] Steve: Did you complete all the levels?
[06/08/2019 14:21] Alex: yes i have
